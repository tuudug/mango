Mango App: Ideas and Mind Map
Here's a breakdown of your ideas, organized into key areas:

Core Concept:

"Game Master" Entity: A virtual entity that motivates and guides the user in their daily life, especially with "optional" tasks.

LLM-Powered: Utilizing LLMs to create an interactive and personalized experience.

Key Features:

Quests:

Generated by the "Game Master" to provide tasks and objectives.

Variety of quests, including very easy tasks to overcome inertia.

Randomly timed, low-pressure quests: The Game Master will message the user with quests at random intervals, adding an element of surprise. These quests should be framed as opportunities, not obligations, and users should never feel guilty for not completing them.

Game Master Personality:

Users can select the Game Master's tone:

Formal: Adheres to proper grammar and punctuation, similar to formal email writing.

Casual: Uses everyday language with correct punctuation and grammar.

"Gen Z": Uses abbreviations, slang, and informal language, similar to text messaging. (Consider alternative name like "Informal" or "Chatty")

Game Master Availability:

Free users have limited Game Master interaction frequency (e.g., 5 messages per hour).

Subscribers have unlimited Game Master interaction.

Trackables:

User-defined statistics to monitor progress (weight, muscle mass, steps, etc.).

Dashboard for displaying tracked statistics.

Progression System:

Virtual currency as a reward system.

Leveling up to unlock new features.

Initial minimal features set.

Customizable Dashboard:

Central hub where users can view progress and plan activities.

Widgets are unlocked and customized through app usage.

Variety of widget types:

Trackable graph

Habit graph

To-do list

Calendar

Sleep/step tracking

Goal Tracker

Journaling Widget

Affirmation Widget

Inspirational Content Widget

Quote of the Day Widget

Achievement Showcase

Social Feed (if desired)

Recipe Widget

Brain Teaser/Puzzle Widget

Monetization:

Subscription-based: $7 per month.

No ads or in-app purchases.

Subscriber Advantages:

Unlimited Game Master interaction.

Early access to new widgets and features.

Exclusive customization options (e.g., premium widget skins, dashboard themes).

Increased reward multiplier (e.g., earn XP and currency 1.5x faster).

Advanced data insights and analytics for trackables.

Priority support.

User Experience (UX):

Minimal user input: Design the app to be as easy to use as possible.

Intuitive interface.

Dashboard customization.

Emphasis on Positive Reinforcement: The app should focus on encouraging positive actions and celebrating successes, no matter how small. Avoid any language or design that could induce guilt or a sense of failure.

LLM Prompting Considerations:

Personalized Quest Generation: The LLM should consider the user's tracked data, past activity, and stated preferences when generating quests.

Motivational Tone: The LLM should adopt a supportive and encouraging tone, similar to a "Game Master." Crucially, the tone should be low-pressure and avoid any hint of judgment. The tone should be customizable by the user (Formal, Casual, Gen Z).

Contextual Awareness: The LLM needs access to user data (trackables, progress, etc.) to provide relevant and helpful guidance.

Adaptability: The LLM should be able to adjust the difficulty and type of quests based on user feedback and progress.

Randomized Timing: The LLM should be able to generate quests at unpredictable intervals, simulating a "Game Master" who checks in periodically.

Urgency and Scarcity (with caveats): The LLM can create quests that expire after a certain time, but this should be done very carefully. The emphasis should be on the opportunity to earn a bonus, not the failure to complete a task.

Game Master Availability: The LLM should adhere to the user's chosen availability level, limiting its interactions accordingly. This could involve a system where the LLM tracks its own "interaction count" within a given time period.
