# Mango App: Project Checklist

Here's a checklist based on the project brief ideas:

## Core Concept

- [ ] **"Game Master" Entity:** A virtual entity that motivates and guides the user.
  - [ ] LLM-Powered: Utilizing LLMs for interaction.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Basic panel exists (`GameMasterPanel.tsx`), includes message input.

## Data Sources & Management

These components handle the interaction and persistence of core application data via React Contexts. **Configuration for data source sidebar buttons (icon, label) is now centralized in `src/lib/dataSourceConfig.ts`.** **API calls within data source contexts are now centralized using `src/lib/apiClient.ts`.**

- [x] **Calendar Data Source (`CalendarDataSource.tsx`):** Manages calendar events (add, delete, view) using `CalendarContext`.
  - **[x] Backend:** Fix token decryption errors. (**Resolved: Incorrect ENV VAR**)
  - **[x] Backend:** Implement refresh token logic. (**Verified: Existing logic works after decryption fix**)
- [x] **Health Data Source (`HealthDataSource.tsx`):** Manages daily step counts (add, update, view) using `HealthContext`.
  - **[x] Backend:** Fix token decryption errors. (**Resolved: Incorrect ENV VAR**)
  - **[x] Backend:** Implement refresh token logic. (**Added: Missing handler in API route**)
  - **[x] Backend:** Fix disconnect logic. (**Fixed: Handler now uses provider from request body**)
- [x] **Todos Data Source (`TodosDataSource.tsx`):** Manages todo items (add, delete, toggle completion) using `TodosContext`.
  - **[x] Editing:** Added ability to edit todo item text.
  - **[x] Reordering:** Top-level items use drag-and-drop; nested items use Move Up/Down buttons.
  - **[x] Sub-items:** Added support for nested sub-items (up to 2 levels).
  - **[x] AI Breakdown:** Added "magic" button to generate sub-tasks using Gemini. **Now includes parent context.**
- [x] **Finance Data Source (`FinanceDataSource.tsx`):** Manages manual finance entries and settings using `FinanceContext`. **Context logic moved to `src/contexts/FinanceContext.tsx`. Panel component renamed/moved.**
  - **[x] Database:** Added `manual_finance_settings` and `manual_finance_entries` tables.
  - **[x] Backend:** Added API routes (`/api/finance`) for settings and entries (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).
  - **[x] Frontend:** Created context, settings panel (in sidebar), expense entry modal. **Modal moved to `src/components/`.**
- [x] **Pomodoro Context (`PomodoroContext.tsx`):** Manages global Pomodoro state (idle, work, break).
- [x] **Ambience Context (`AmbienceContext.tsx`):** Manages background audio playback state and volume using Web Audio API.

## Key Features

### Quests

- [ ] Generated by the "Game Master".
- [ ] Variety of quests (including easy ones).
- [ ] Randomly timed, low-pressure quests.

### Game Master

- [ ] **Personality/Tone Customization (via Paths):**
  - [ ] Unlock Casual tone.
  - [ ] Unlock Formal tone.
  - [ ] Unlock "Gen Z" / Informal tone.
- [ ] **Availability Limits / Upgrades (via Paths / Subscription):**
  - [ ] Base limit for free users.
  - [ ] Unlock increased limit (Path node?).
  - [ ] Unlimited interaction for subscribers.

### Trackables

- [ ] User-defined statistics (weight, steps, etc.).
- [x] Dashboard display for tracked stats (Partially done - widgets exist, data is static for some).
- [x] **Finance Tracking:**
  - [x] Daily Allowance Widget (`DailyAllowanceWidget.tsx`) - Shows remaining daily budget. **Layout improved.**
  - [x] Expenses Report Widget (`ExpensesReportWidget.tsx`) - Shows weekly spending bar chart.

### Progression System

- [ ] Virtual currency rewards.
- [x] Leveling up (XP gain) - _UI placeholder added to sidebar_.
- [x] **Paths System:**
  - [x] Concept: User selects one linear path at a time; XP contributes to path progress. Switching paths resets progress towards the _next_ item on the previous path.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Implemented as a sliding panel (`PathsPage.tsx`) showing defined paths, active path indication (star icon), progress bar for active path, unlock status (lock/check icon), XP costs, and path switching confirmation.
  - [ ] Path Definition: Finalize items, order, XP costs, level requirements per path.
  - [x] Implementation: Logic for path selection, progress tracking, unlocking items (state managed in `LeftSidebar.tsx` now, saved to localStorage - _Path state only_).
  - [ ] XP Gain Mechanism: Define how users earn XP (e.g., completing quests, using widgets).
- [ ] Widgets unlocked/customized through app usage (via Paths / Shop).
- [ ] **Shop:**
  - [ ] Concept: Purchase widget themes/styles.
  - [ ] Currency: Use virtual currency.
  - [ ] Items: Define specific themes/styles.
  - [ ] Implementation: Build the UI and logic.

  - [x] Backend API (`/api/dashboards`) created to GET/PUT layouts.
  - [x] Supabase table (`user_dashboard_layouts`) created.

  - [x] Cache used on initial load; stale cache updated on focus.
  - [x] Fetches forced on entering/exiting edit mode or switching edit target.

## User Experience (UX)

- [x] Dashboard customization implemented.
- [x] **Widget Adding:** Replaced drag-and-drop with click-to-add from toolbox.

  - [x] Panels use `max-width` for responsiveness.
  - [x] Background overlay added when panels are open.
- [x] **Edit Mode Interaction:**
  - [x] Exiting edit mode always returns to the default desktop view.

- **[x] Collapse on Drag:** Todo list items collapse during drag to improve DnD experience.
- **[x] Dashboard Loading:** Improved loading state to avoid full-screen flash (further improved by caching & background fetching).
- **[x] Dark Mode:** Forced dark mode via CSS, ignoring device preference.
- **[x] Development Aids:** Added widget coordinate display in dev mode.
- **[x] Pomodoro Banner:** Banner now pushes content down instead of overlaying.
- **[x] API Call Refactoring:** Centralized authenticated API calls into `src/lib/apiClient.ts` (`authenticatedFetch` function).

- [ ] Motivational Tone (customizable via Paths, low-pressure).
- [x] Contextual Awareness (access to user data - **Improved for Todo breakdown**).
- [ ] Adaptability (adjust quest difficulty).
- [ ] Randomized Timing.
- [ ] Urgency/Scarcity (carefully implemented).
- [ ] Adherence to Game Master Availability limits (upgradable via Paths/Subscription).
- **[x] Task Breakdown:** Implemented Gemini integration for breaking down todo items, including prompt refinement **and parent context**.
