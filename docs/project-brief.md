# Mango App: Project Checklist

Here's a checklist based on the project brief ideas:

## Core Concept

- [ ] **"Game Master" Entity:** A virtual entity that motivates and guides the user.
  - [ ] LLM-Powered: Utilizing LLMs for interaction.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Basic panel exists (`GameMasterPanel.tsx`), includes message input.

## Key Features

### Quests

- [ ] Generated by the "Game Master".
- [ ] Variety of quests (including easy ones).
- [ ] Randomly timed, low-pressure quests.

### Game Master

- [ ] **Personality/Tone Customization (via Paths):**
  - [ ] Unlock Casual tone.
  - [ ] Unlock Formal tone.
  - [ ] Unlock "Gen Z" / Informal tone.
- [ ] **Availability Limits / Upgrades (via Paths / Subscription):**
  - [ ] Base limit for free users.
  - [ ] Unlock increased limit (Path node?).
  - [ ] Unlimited interaction for subscribers.

### Trackables

- [ ] User-defined statistics (weight, steps, etc.).
- [ ] Dashboard display for tracked stats (Partially done - widgets exist, data is static).

### Progression System

- [ ] Virtual currency rewards.
- [x] Leveling up (XP gain) - _UI placeholder added to sidebar_.
- [x] **Paths System:**
  - [x] Concept: User selects one linear path at a time; XP contributes to path progress. Switching paths resets progress towards the _next_ item on the previous path.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Implemented as a sliding panel (`PathsPage.tsx`) showing defined paths, active path indication (star icon), progress bar for active path, unlock status (lock/check icon), XP costs, and path switching confirmation.
  - [ ] Path Definition: Finalize items, order, XP costs, level requirements per path.
  - [ ] Implementation: Logic for path selection, progress tracking, unlocking items (state managed in `Dashboard.tsx`, saved to localStorage).
  - [ ] XP Gain Mechanism: Define how users earn XP (e.g., completing quests, using widgets).
- [ ] Widgets unlocked/customized through app usage (via Paths / Shop).
- [ ] **Shop:**
  - [ ] Concept: Purchase widget themes/styles.
  - [ ] Currency: Use virtual currency.
  - [ ] Items: Define specific themes/styles.
  - [ ] Implementation: Build the UI and logic.

### Customizable Dashboard

- [x] Central hub for progress and planning (`Dashboard.tsx`).
- [x] Add/Move/Resize widgets (`react-grid-layout` integration).
- [x] Layout persistence (`localStorage` - layout only, no widget data).
- [x] **Refined Widget List & Categories (Used for Paths):**
  - **Productivity:**
    - [x] To-do List (`TodoListWidget.tsx`)
    - [x] Month Calendar (`MonthCalendarWidget.tsx`)
