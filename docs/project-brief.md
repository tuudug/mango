# Mango App: Project Checklist

Here's a checklist based on the project brief ideas:

## Core Concept

- [ ] **"Game Master" Entity:** A virtual entity that motivates and guides the user.
  - [ ] LLM-Powered: Utilizing LLMs for interaction.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Basic panel exists (`GameMasterPanel.tsx`), includes message input.

## Data Sources & Management

These components handle the interaction and persistence of core application data via React Contexts.

- [x] **Calendar Data Source (`CalendarDataSource.tsx`):** Manages calendar events (add, delete, view) using `CalendarContext`.
  - [ ] **Backend:** Fix token decryption errors.
  - [ ] **Backend:** Implement refresh token logic.
- [x] **Health Data Source (`HealthDataSource.tsx`):** Manages daily step counts (add, update, view) using `HealthContext`.
  - [ ] **Backend:** Fix token decryption errors.
  - [ ] **Backend:** Implement refresh token logic.
- [x] **Todos Data Source (`TodosDataSource.tsx`):** Manages todo items (add, delete, toggle completion) using `TodosContext`.
  - **[x] Editing:** Added ability to edit todo item text.
  - **[x] Reordering:** Top-level items use drag-and-drop; nested items use Move Up/Down buttons.
  - **[x] Sub-items:** Added support for nested sub-items (up to 2 levels).
  - **[x] AI Breakdown:** Added "magic" button to generate sub-tasks using Gemini. **Now includes parent task context.**

## Key Features

### Quests

- [ ] Generated by the "Game Master".
- [ ] Variety of quests (including easy ones).
- [ ] Randomly timed, low-pressure quests.

### Game Master

- [ ] **Personality/Tone Customization (via Paths):**
  - [ ] Unlock Casual tone.
  - [ ] Unlock Formal tone.
  - [ ] Unlock "Gen Z" / Informal tone.
- [ ] **Availability Limits / Upgrades (via Paths / Subscription):**
  - [ ] Base limit for free users.
  - [ ] Unlock increased limit (Path node?).
  - [ ] Unlimited interaction for subscribers.

### Trackables

- [ ] User-defined statistics (weight, steps, etc.).
- [ ] Dashboard display for tracked stats (Partially done - widgets exist, data is static).

### Progression System

- [ ] Virtual currency rewards.
- [x] Leveling up (XP gain) - _UI placeholder added to sidebar_.
- [x] **Paths System:**
  - [x] Concept: User selects one linear path at a time; XP contributes to path progress. Switching paths resets progress towards the _next_ item on the previous path.
  - [x] UI Mockup: Implemented as a sliding panel (`PathsPage.tsx`) showing defined paths, active path indication (star icon), progress bar for active path, unlock status (lock/check icon), XP costs, and path switching confirmation.
  - [ ] Path Definition: Finalize items, order, XP costs, level requirements per path.
  - [x] Implementation: Logic for path selection, progress tracking, unlocking items (state managed in `LeftSidebar.tsx` now, saved to localStorage - _Path state only_).
  - [ ] XP Gain Mechanism: Define how users earn XP (e.g., completing quests, using widgets).
- [ ] Widgets unlocked/customized through app usage (via Paths / Shop).
- [ ] **Shop:**
  - [ ] Concept: Purchase widget themes/styles.
  - [ ] Currency: Use virtual currency.
  - [ ] Items: Define specific themes/styles.
  - [ ] Implementation: Build the UI and logic.

### Customizable Dashboard

- [x] Central hub for progress and planning (`Dashboard.tsx`).
- [x] Add/Move/Resize widgets (`react-grid-layout` integration).
- [x] **Layout persistence (Database):**
  - [x] Backend API (`/api/dashboards`) created to GET/PUT layouts.
  - [x] Supabase table (`user_dashboard_layouts`) created.
  - [x] Frontend (`useDashboardLayout` hook) fetches/saves layouts via API.
- [x] **Layout Caching (Local Storage):**
  - [x] Layouts ('default', 'mobile') cached to reduce API calls.
  - [x] Last sync time stored to check cache staleness (12hr).
  - [x] Cache used on initial load; stale cache updated on focus.
  - [x] Fetches forced on entering/exiting edit mode or switching edit target.
- [x] **Mobile Layout Support:**
  - [x] Separate 'mobile' layout fetched/saved via API & cached.
  - [x] Automatic loading of 'mobile' or 'default' layout based on screen width (initial load).
  - [x] Mobile Edit Mode UI implemented (toggle in edit bar, narrow preview, filtered toolbox).
  - [x] Mobile edit preview uses separate grid instance (`DashboardGrid.tsx`).
- [ ] **Multiple Named Dashboards:** (Future - requires UI for management)
- [x] **Refined Widget List & Categories (Used for Paths):**
  - **Productivity:**
    - [x] To-do List (`TodoListWidget.tsx` -> `TodoList/index.tsx`) - **Enhanced with Edit, Reorder (DnD/Buttons), Sub-items, AI Breakdown (w/ Context)**
    - [x] Month Calendar (`MonthCalendarWidget.tsx`)
    - [x] Daily Calendar (`DailyCalendarWidget.tsx`)
    - [x] Goal Tracker (`GoalTrackerWidget.tsx`)

    - [x] Habit Graph (`HabitGraphWidget.tsx`)
    - [ ] Sleep Widget (_Separated from Steps_) (`SleepStepWidget.tsx` needs refactor)
      - [ ] _Upgrade:_ Sleep Analysis
      - [ ] _Upgrade:_ Daily Routine Generator
    - [ ] Air Quality Widget
  - **Mindfulness/Focus:**
    - [x] Journaling Widget (`JournalWidget.tsx`)
    - [ ] Affirmation Widget

## Monetization

- [ ] Subscription-based ($7/month).
- [ ] No ads or IAPs.
- [ ] **Subscriber Advantages:**
  - [ ] Unlimited Game Master interaction (Overrides path limit?).
  - [ ] Early access to new features/widgets.
  - [ ] Exclusive customization options (Shop items?).
  - [ ] Increased reward multiplier.
  - [ ] Advanced data insights/analytics.
  - [ ] Priority support.

## User Experience (UX)

- [ ] Minimal user input focus.
- [x] Intuitive interface (Implemented Left sidebar, sliding panels for Toolbox, GM, Profile, Paths).
- [x] Dashboard customization implemented.
- [x] **Panel Behavior:**
  - [x] Panels (except Toolbox) slide over the dashboard content.
  - [x] State and rendering for sliding panels moved into `LeftSidebar.tsx`.
  - [x] Panels use `max-width` for responsiveness.
  - [x] Background overlay added when panels are open.
- [x] **Edit Mode Interaction:**
  - [x] Exiting edit mode always returns to the default desktop view.
  - [x] Attempting to open a panel during edit mode shakes the edit indicator and shows a toast.
- [ ] Emphasis on Positive Reinforcement (Guiding principle).
- **[x] PWA Update Notifications:** Implemented prompt for app updates & fixed update flow.
- **[x] Toast Notifications:** Added system for user feedback (`useToast` context).
- **[x] Collapse on Drag:** Todo list items collapse during drag to improve DnD experience.
- **[x] Dashboard Loading:** Improved loading state to avoid full-screen flash (further improved by caching).

## LLM Prompting Considerations

- [ ] Personalized Quest Generation (using user data).
- [ ] Motivational Tone (customizable via Paths, low-pressure).
- [x] Contextual Awareness (access to user data - **Improved for Todo breakdown**).
- [ ] Adaptability (adjust quest difficulty).
- [ ] Randomized Timing.
- [ ] Urgency/Scarcity (carefully implemented).
- [ ] Adherence to Game Master Availability limits (upgradable via Paths/Subscription).
- **[x] Task Breakdown:** Implemented Gemini integration for breaking down todo items, including prompt refinement **and parent context**.
