# TodoList Widget Refactoring Summary (April 2025)

## Goal

The primary goal of this refactoring was to address the complexity and large size of the original `src/widgets/TodoListWidget.tsx` file. By breaking it down into smaller, more focused components, we aimed to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.

## Changes Implemented

1.  **Directory Structure:** All refactored components now reside within the `src/widgets/TodoList/` directory.
2.  **Component Breakdown:**
    - **`TodoList/index.tsx`:** The main widget container. It handles:
      - Fetching data from `TodosContext`.
      - Managing the overall expansion state (`expandedItems`).
      - Setting up the `DndContext` for drag-and-drop (top-level only).
      - Rendering the top-level input field and progress bar.
      - Rendering the list of top-level `TodoListItem` components.
      - Calculating completion statistics.
      - Handling drag start (collapsing items) and drag end logic for top-level items.
      - Providing placeholder move up/down handlers (passed down).
    - **`TodoList/TodoListItem.tsx`:** Represents a single todo item in the list (potentially recursive). It handles:
      - Displaying the item's title, checkbox, and indentation based on level.
      - Rendering its own children recursively if it has any and is expanded.
      - Integrating with `dnd-kit/sortable` (disabled for nested items).
      - Conditionally rendering either the display text or the edit form.
      - Rendering the `TodoItemActions` component.
      - Using the `useTodoItemEditing` custom hook.
      - Calling context `moveTodo` function via local handlers.
      - Conditionally disabling expand/collapse animation during drag via `isDraggingTopLevel` prop.
    - **`TodoList/TodoItemActions.tsx`:** Renders the action buttons (Edit, Delete, Add Sub-item, Breakdown, Move Up, Move Down, Drag Handle) based on the item's state and level. Receives necessary handlers and DnD attributes/listeners as props.
    - **`TodoList/TodoItemEditForm.tsx`:** A controlled component specifically for the inline editing input field. It manages its own text state and calls `onSave` or `onCancel` props when editing is finished (Enter, Escape, Blur).
3.  **Logic & State Management:**
    - **Simplified Recursion:** The `renderChildren` prop was removed. `TodoListItem` now directly maps over its `children` array to render nested items.
    - **Context Usage:** `TodoListItem` now directly uses `toggleTodo`, `deleteTodo`, and `moveTodo` from `TodosContext`, reducing prop drilling.
    - **Custom Hook (`useTodoItemEditing`):** Introduced within `TodoListItem.tsx` to encapsulate the `isEditing` state and the logic for starting, canceling, and saving edits.
4.  **Integration:**
    - The original `src/widgets/TodoListWidget.tsx` file was updated to simply re-export the main component (`TodoListWidget`) from `src/widgets/TodoList/index.tsx`.
5.  **Reordering Logic Update:**
    - Drag-and-drop reordering is now **disabled** for nested items (level 1 and 2).
    - "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons were added to `TodoItemActions` for items with `level > 0`.
    - A new context function `moveTodo` was added to `TodosContext.tsx` to handle the API call and optimistic updates for moving items.
    - A new backend API endpoint `PUT /api/todos/manual/:itemId/move` was created in `api/src/routes/todos/moveTodo.ts`.
    - This endpoint calls a new PostgreSQL function `move_todo_item` (SQL provided separately) which handles the atomic swapping of item positions within their siblings. **This function must be created manually in the Supabase database.** Permissions were granted to `authenticated` and `service_role`.
6.  **Drag Animation Fix:**
    - Added `isDraggingTopLevel` state to `TodoListWidget`.
    - `onDragStart` now sets this state to `true` and collapses items.
    - `onDragEnd` resets the state to `false`.
    - The state is passed down to `TodoListItem`.
    - The expand/collapse animation transition is conditionally disabled in `TodoListItem` when `isDraggingTopLevel` is true, preventing interference with drag calculations.

## Outcome

This refactoring results in a more modular and understandable structure for the TodoList feature. Each component now has a clearer, more defined responsibility. Reordering logic has been simplified by restricting drag-and-drop to the top level and using buttons for nested levels, improving usability and reducing complexity. The drag-and-drop experience for top-level items is also improved by disabling conflicting animations.
